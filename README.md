# PyCMF with GT4Py

## Objectives

This project is based on a previous work called PyCMF which aimed to experiment Object-Oriented technology and the use of Python in a Climate Modelling context. It concluded that OO brings a lot of flexibility and modularity to the code, but that it is not the best choice for performance. This project aims to improve the performance of the PyCMF framework by using GT4Py, a library that allows to generate high-performance code for stencil computations on structured grids. This project aimed to keep as much as possible the original structure of PyCMF, while adding the GT4Py code generation for the most performance-critical parts of the code. We will see that the performance of the code is greatly improved, but that the OO structure of PyCMF had to be adapted to the GT4Py code generation especially for the grid modelisation.

The graphical interface of PyCMF has not been ported to this version, as it was not the main focus of this project.

## Introduction

Python Climate Modelling Framework (or PyCMF for short) is a framework developped by Nathan Marotte as part of his Master's thesis at the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles. 

- base_class (earth_base, sun_base, etc ...) and inheriting from BaseModel : Contains the basic
  structural/pythonic stuff for the class (correct inheritance, redefinition of dunder methods, etc ...)
- physical_class (earth, sun, etc ...) and inheriting from its base_class : Contains the physical properties (temperature, mass, etc ...) and
  method (behaviour for receiving electromagnetic radiation, etc ... ) for that class 
- ticking_class (ticking_earth, ticking_universe, etc ...) and inheriting from its physical_class as well as
  TickableModel, that is an interface to store all the class methods that have to be executed at each time step of the
  simulation via the `@TickableModel.on_tick` decorator

The framework is currently **not** able to provide accurate simulations of real-world physical process, but provides a
few examples with placeholder simulations such as the averaging of the temperature at each time step

## Running the code

### Required Libraries

- numpy for the models
- GT4Py for the stencils generation


To run the framework, you can edit the script in `main.py` and then execute it with `python3.11 src/main.py`.



## How to add a new model

To add a new model, you have to add between 1 and 3 files since the models are split in 3 different layers. First, create your $model.py file in physical_class and add all the physical properties of that model you need. Then, if necessary, create another file in base_class to handle all the pythonic behavior, such as iteration behavior, adding, substracting, memory use, data storage, saving the simulation, loading a simulation, etc ... Don't forget to make your second layer model inherit from the first layer model.

Finally, if you model has some variables that are updated over time, you will have to create a third file in ticking_class to define the different updates behavior with the `@TickingModel.on_tick(enabled=True)` decorator that you obtain by inheriting from TickingModel. Also, you must inherit from your second layer class to get all of your physical properties variables on which the update is done.

## How to add a new variable to the model

To enrich the framework, you can add new physical properties and all their associated methods for conveniance (getters, setters, etc ... ) in the second layer, physical_class. You can also change the `__init__` method of the class to allow for setting your variable when the model is built, in which case you will have to find the other use of that model and change the constructor's parameters as well.

Then, if your variable has a temporal dimension to it, you can add the temporal evolution in the third layer, ticking_class, where you can define a function decorated by `@TickingModel.on_tick(enabled=True)`
